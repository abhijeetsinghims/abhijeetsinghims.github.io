Hello everyone,

This message is for all those who are frowning upon the lockdown or the failure of the system.

For those who don’t believe that Corona is a pandemic and have difficulty wearing masks or getting a diagnosis.

  

You all better shut the fuck up and listen. It’s not anymore a question of what you believe and what you don’t. What you are? Another case with a bed number. And be assured the world is not going to stop even if you die. In fact, it would have been better if you did so in the first wave.

  

I have lost 3 of my faculties, 4 of my friends, and more than a dozen people whom I directly or indirectly know in the second wave. Notwithstanding who you are, what you believe, what you do, how rich you are how many people follow you, what kind of political party you voted for, nothing can come to help once this infection gets into your body.

  

You could have blamed the government, the system, the ruling party, your neighborhood, or even god. But the answer is we all did this mess. We were ignoring the masks and distancing guidelines when the virus was slow, now when it is taking the toll we are crying for help. 

Last year in October I started learning data science to advance my career and get some new skills. I started taking data samples from the internet. Initially, it was car models and music trends but then Covid came. First, I had infection sample data, then came spread graphs, then there were the deaths. More than half of the data analysis I do these days is either how many have died or how many will die? Projections say still the peak is yet to come.

This is a projection system for COVID spread by The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. I knew my analysis would be questioned, so here is it from a proper reliable source.
 
I want my models to fail and all analytics to go down the gutter.

Please come together and save yourself and the family.

1.  Wear a mask. (if possible a double mask)
    
2.  Always sanitize before you enter your home
    
3.  If you live in a containment zone or have a member of family positive, wear a mask inside your home as well
    
4.  If you have symptoms, get treatment as soon as possible. We really really really don’t have the kind of infrastructure for health care as per the numbers that are coming up. Neither the oxygen supply nor the injections can guarantee you a 100% recovery.
    
Some of the users will now blame me for spreading negativity and panic. But if panic keeps all of us safe and alive, be it. As for the dying part, this really is not a good time to do so. You won’t even get a proper funeral. We all are gonna die, but not today. Today we fight.

So stop blaming the government and break the chain and stay safe.
