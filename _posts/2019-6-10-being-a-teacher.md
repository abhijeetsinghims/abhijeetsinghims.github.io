##### About me
###### The pain called UGC NET 
I still search for the day and the moment that I decided to pursue teaching. What seemed just like talking endlessly and bossing around students came at a cost. A senior professor once told me that “Abhijeet, teaching is a difficult thing to do. Take your choice wisely.” At that point, I thought he was being sarcastic or overly cautious. He was right. There is so much to study in management alone. I am trying really hard to focus and comprehend as much as I can. 
Given that I was getting fed up of studies and the great summer sun is about to reach 48 degree Celsius, I have to depend on my age-old friend of coding to relax my brain. 

###### Why Programming?
Although a lot of philosophical answers can be written to it, I like to summarise it as easily as possible. I code because I like it. The joy of creating something meaningful. The magic of making a machine dance to your tunes and of learning. I view coding as a service to humanity. It's a skill you can take without any backing in literature or a degree. I have a very innovative definition of code: It's logic that translates from the brain to the syntax through a language and creates something wonderful. Programming is love. <3

###### About Teaching 
Speaking of teaching, I have immense respect for primary and pre-primary teachers. Handling those toddlers and their relentless energy feels like a diffcult task ot me. I remember an incident from the tragic day I took the risk to teach the kids Hour of Code, the queries raised were so innocent yet genuine that I couldn’t but just stare them in the face. “Bhaiya, why is this thing called A and not B?”   

###### Data 
So here I am quoting an article from the recent report by the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) education section <contd>
