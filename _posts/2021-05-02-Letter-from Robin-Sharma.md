title: A message from Robin Sharma

---




**Oh, the struggle**...

...we struggle for our dreams and to insulate our hopes against the criticism of naysayers.

...we struggle to advance in the direction of the values we hold dear in a cold world where many have closed their hearts.

...we struggle to find joy, quiet and inner peace at a time of exponential noise and widespread complexity.

Abhijeet, if you were to ask me “Robin, if there was only one thing I could do to turn struggle into strength and busy into results, what would it be?” I’d say this...

...work on you. **Your inner core.** Because **life always reflects you.**

And yet, inner greatness is so much more about simply thinking more positively...

...I wanted to do something super-special to help you build a brave and brilliant inner life, the kind that inspires you to do amazing work, realize epic wins and experience the genuine gorgeousness of a life well-lived.

We hear so much about “mindset” these days yet what’s the point of a smart mind with a toxic heart, stuck in the past over old hurts? And it’s not just about growing a great Mindset and purifying what I call your Heartset...

...a true hero and legendary producer also optimizes their Healthset so they have excellent energy as well as elevating what I call Soulset, so they serve the world.

*You see Abhijeet, outer empires CANNOT be made without the construction of inner ones.*
