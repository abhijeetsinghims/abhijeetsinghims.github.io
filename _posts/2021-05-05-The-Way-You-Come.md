title: The Way You Come

--
A small poem I wrote in my college days. Excuse the chessiness although.


Filled with agony I begin to lose temperance,

feeling lost with pain and distress.

Waiting for you to come,

looking repeatedly at the gate

to get my favorite sight.

The interlude ceases and

you appear in distance smiling at me.

My heartbeat increases,

blood thumps away from my limbs,

my hands get cold,

I begin to feel nervous, trying to get remember

what i wanted to say all the night.

I come back to life with the touch on my face.

And everything begins to melt…..
