title: Social Media Detox
---

I read an article in a newspaper today about how the youth are giving up on social media due to the way it kills productivity and forces them to have a consistent image everywhere. Almost 4.8 billion social media apps were downloaded in Q1 of 2019, with Tiktok by Bytedance leading the scene*.  Various youngsters believe that social media is a productivity killer and precious time consumer. The article concluded with a remark by a digital strategist, who says that it is not worthy of being missed.

##### My views 
It has loomed out of a place where people came to meet and greet their friends and have pushed out to the point that almost everyone thinks of themselves as a brand. We have more writers on philosophies and ideologies than there are readers.
