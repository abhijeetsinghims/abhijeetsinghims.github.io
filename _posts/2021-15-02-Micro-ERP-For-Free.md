title: Micro ERP System 
---

I am proud to present a ERP system for free. 

So here is the story. 
Last month, my milkman told me that he wants to do upgrade his business and maintain hi-tech accounts like big shops and supermarkets, but his budget was limited. So here is where the idea stuck.
COVID has hit us hard. Smaller business the worse. They want solutions but they cannot afford them. They face issues with these problems:
Inventory management
Order Management
Accounts
E-Commerce Integration.
And they want all of this in a way that does not kill their profit. 
Therefore, I humbly present my own creation, A Mini ERP system for everyone with the following features:
No installation required. 
Data import export compatibility with your existing software and platforms.
Robust Microsoft Power Platform. 
Cloud-Ready. Works on your Mobile as an app.
Completely customizable as per your needs. 

If you are from Ujjain or Indore you can get this at a bargain price. #vocalforlocal #india #ujjain #indore #erp #product #software #enablingsmallbusiness #covid-19


 Please donâ€™t ask for free, it took me time to build this and even more to learn.
