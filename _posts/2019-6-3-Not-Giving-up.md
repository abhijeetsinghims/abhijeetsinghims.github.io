title: Not Giving Up 
---

I got much bored today. For how hard it can be to learn about this field. How can it take so long? How can it be so vast? 
Made me feel like I must give up. Why was I even doing this? I have got an easy life. I could teach at another college. 
Be another teacher. Clear a few exams and live a happy and peaceful life. That could be the best way. 
But here I am losing the prime of my life on something I consider important and yes it is taking a toll on me. Mental, physical
and financial. Even friends and family are bothered about my growing waist size. Sleeping late from the webinars and getting up early for the walk. No way this could be the end. This is not where I give up. 



I have to believe in _Veer Bhogya Vasundhara_ which means that the Earth will be enjoyed by the brave or only the valiant deserves to rule.
Data Science is difficult. For a person like me who has been as far off from anything mathematical as possible, it is like an making a journey
from the North Pole to the South on a canoe, alone. Giving up is not a solution. Because I have started it on my own and will finish it on my own. Being brave is not only fighting a battle with a sword. 
This time it is with a keyboard. 
And like all past battles with the keyboard, I will win it.
