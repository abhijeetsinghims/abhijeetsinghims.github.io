title: How I ditched my Migraine without any medicines.
---

Migraine is a havoc. It attacks at anytime and makes your irritating to others and useless for yourself. 
I had been  suffering from migraine and other types of headaches from the last three years or so. Initially I din’t even knew it was migraine. I have a history with depression and I had fought it well as well (more on that story later)  so I  thought of this headache as a collinear effect. As all other symptoms of depression faded with treatment, headache stayed and made me irritable to the level of me pulling my own hair. I felt like a mad man. 
Whenever I was free I tried work on getting it out, initially there seemed to be a dead end. Some friends and family told it will stay forever.  But I could not submit to it. How on earth will I live the rest of my life? Will this pain stay like this? There must be an answer.
So I built my own concoction of herbal and homeopathic drugs after reading books, manuals and whatever literature I could get my hands on. 

## Diet
### Vitamins
I do consume a lot of vitamins generally and don’t care about they are balanced or not. I had to give up most of this.  
### Coffee
I loved and lived off the coffee machine. I had tried everything from Arabita, Robusta, Intense, Single Estate, Black Ivory and the list goes on. The love and desire was so intense that I had my own personal espresso maker near my bed. It was poisonous relationship. With the caffeine hurting me a lot. Had to give it up too.

## Lifestyle
### Sleep
This comes in two parts. 1. Get enough sleep. 2. Get sleep on time
### Exercise 
Do at least twice a week, if not daily.  Also started deep breathing session once a day just for 10 minutes. 


## Medicine
### Herbal
I believe in Ayurveda and its effects. I tried Saraswatarishta and Smriti Sagar Ras for the betterment. The combo has been the most effective one that I have tried. Do try them if you can find them in your local store.

### Homeopathy
Did consume the following liquids, although I am not sure whether they were effective or not.  R - 16 and Vita C-15 by Dr Reckweg.
